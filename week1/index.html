          I'm currently working in beauty as a nail technican which I've done
          for 5 years and I think it's time for a change

          I did do some coding in ALevel Computing<br />
          and in university studying Digital Media Design and made a website but
          completely forgot most of it so I would like to get back into it

      <ol class="unordered-list">
        <li>
          I want to learn code as I feel as if its a good skill to learn with
          not many women being in this industry
        </li>
        <li>
          Want to change careers as there's so many opportunities in tech and
          tech is the future!
        </li>
        <li>Travel more and hopefully work remotely</li>
        <li>Make more money!! ;)) hehe</li>
        <li>
          Push myself out of my comfort zone and try something new because why
          not! Life's too short <br />
          even if it's not for me at least I've tried for me to know.
        </li>
        <li>Find my passion</li>
        <li>Progress and growth</li>
        <li>Meet more like minded/new people</li>
        <li>
          Discover more career choices in tech but so far I would like to become
          a front-end developer.
